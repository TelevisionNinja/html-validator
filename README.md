# html-validator
This was a university project where I had to make an HTML validator. I went above and beyond by making it validate any HTML other than the ones provided for the project.

## Example Output Messages:
### Tag Nesting Error
![nest](./images/nest.png)
### End Tag Error
![end_tag](./images/end_tag.png)
### Valid HTML
![valid](./images/valid.png)
